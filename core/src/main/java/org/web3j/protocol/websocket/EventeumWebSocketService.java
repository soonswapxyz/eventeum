 * Web3j seems to fail when closing websocket in pubsub mode.  This causes
 * a deadlock when attempting to reconnect to the node, as the close latch in WebSocketClient
 * never gets released and the reconnection block indefinitely.
 *
 * This is workaround until web3j 4 which should hopefully have built in reconnections.
